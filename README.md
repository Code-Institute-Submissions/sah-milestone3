## Steven A. Horne - Web Designer & Full Stack Web Developer

The site is the personal portfolio and blog of a web developer and designer.  The site will display information about the the author's skills, education and read their blog page as well as contact them.

The main goals of the site are: 

* Build an online prescence and promote the developer's services/brand
* Encourage people to use the Contact Page with enquiries
* Simple and clear UX for users to navigate
* Provide a blog to share the developer's experiences

## UX

The site is intended for anyone who is interested in web design/development and/or those who are looking for assistance with a project/site.

The site bosts a simple and easy to use interface which is easy to navigate.  The site contains a front page with a Navbar which links to all other page except the **Blog Admin** page (see below).

### Admin section

The Admin section can ONLY be accessed by adding /admin at the end on the url.  This is to prevent access to unauthorised users.
In the Admin section, adminstrators can create, edit and delete posts in the Blog.

## User Stories

* As a potential customer I want to be able to see the developer's skills and/or work.
* As a potential customer I want to be able to visit their website and be able to easily navigate arount and be able to contact the developer.
* As a potential customer I want to be able to see if their own site is professionally designed and easy to use.
* As a potantial customer I want fo find out information about the developer.
* As a web developer I want to compare the developer's site to my own.
* As a web developer I want to see what the site offers and if it offers anything different.

## Features

### Existing Features

The site is navigated by means of the Navbar from where all pages can be accessed and it remains at the top of the page when scrolling.  The user can return to the Home page by either clicking/pressing the Home link of the House icon.

The Education page utilises a timeline to visually show education/employment history and other milestones.

The Experience page displays a list of icons of various technologies/software which the developer has experience.  The user can click each icon which will open a modal popup displaying the number of years of experience and some information about the relevant item.

The Contact page has a simple form the user can contact the developer.

The Blog page shows the developer's stories and experiences. The user can expand each story by means of a button on each post.

The site utilises the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the Blog section. 

###Features to implement

The need or a seperate login facility for administrators is the main requirement outstanding.
